## Context

I created Emoji-Story as a short, fun and educational project while exploring AWS (Amazon Web Services) Cloud. The project combines technology and creativity, showcasing an accessible interaction using AI and cloud computing.

## Technologies Used

Emoji-Story is a multi-faceted project that leverages several cutting-edge technologies to provide its unique functionality. Here are the key technologies and tools used in this project:

- **Node.js Express**: The backend of Emoji-Story is built using Node.js and Express, providing a robust and scalable server framework.

- **React.js**: The frontend is developed with React.js, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.

- **Nginx**: Nginx is used as a reverse proxy server to efficiently handle incoming requests and distribute traffic to the appropriate components.

- **Redis**: Cache and manage data efficiently, enhancing performance and reducing response times.

- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrate and manage containerized components, making deployment and scaling straightforward.

- **Docker**: Encapsulate and isolate individual parts of the application, simplifying development, and deployment processes.

- **OpenAI API**: Tapping into natural language processing capabilities to generate compelling short stories based on user inputs.

- **[EmojiHub](https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub)**: An API that provides access to emojis from sorted categories and groups.
This project also has a self-hosted (Golang) equivalent.
Emoji-story and the redis deployment utilizes both the API and the self hosted version for random emoji generation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Set up the OpenAI API integration by obtaining an API key from the OpenAI website. Update the configuration files with your API key.
